        <!-- Blade and Pic -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column , review-box">
                <h4>Blade</h4>
                <p>The blade design is very different to say the least. I think it looks like a T-rex skull which is probably
                    what they were going for. It is nice that the knife follows the theme all the way from the tip of the
                    blade to the end of the handle. There are a few different ways that the blade can come either with the
                    very stylistic veff serrations or without and it comes in a couple different colors. On the top of the
                    blade right out of the handle there is about 5/16 in. of small jimping that is hard to feel but surprisingly
                    grippy. At the tightness I prefer the blade does lean to one side but does not touch.</p>

        <!-- Pivot and Opener -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column , review-box">
                <h4>Pivot / Opener</h4>
                <p>The Fossil uses a ball bearing pivot which feels great while opening and closing. The opener is one of
                    the best I have felt in a sub $100 knife. On one side there is a torx on the other it is fixed to not
                    rotate in the handle. After many times of opening and closing the blade I have not had any issues with
                    it coming loose. The opener is a flipper style which is jimped and kind of flat on the top but is a very
                    smooth angle while it is in your pocket.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="one-half column , review-box">
                <h4>Handle and lock</h4>
                <p>The handle has a metal frame that mostly shows and has a hammered look to it. On the outside of that there are G10 scales screed to the outside which also have divots in them. The G10 with divots adds quite a bit of grip and style. On the metal liners there is slightly rounded jimping on the butt of the handle on the top and bottom for being held in different positions.</p>

        <!-- Ergonomics Final Thoughts -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column , review-box">
                <h4>Ergonomics</h4>
                <p>On the bottom of this knife every curve is to fit your fingers while holding it the normal way and with the blade by your pinky. The flipper when opened acts as a finger guard so your finger can never slip onto the blade. One thing that isn't as good for some people is that there is not a way to choke up on the knife. The pocket clip does protrude quite a bit but it still does not interfere too much with your grip.</p>
